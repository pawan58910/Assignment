        "\n",
        "This refers to bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components, which is achieved through access modifiers (such as private, protected, and public). Encapsulation helps protect the internal state of an object from unwanted external changes and ensures that the objectâ€™s behavior remains consistent."

        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). Polymorphism increases flexibility and allows for more generic and reusable code."

Composition provides greater flexibility than inheritance, as objects can be composed dynamically, allowing more complex and adaptable designs.\n",
